# Overview

Welcome to my Data Analysis application! My hope with this application was to learn more about data analysis with Python.

# Data Analysis Results

I decided to analyze 3 pieces of data. President, NASDAQ price, and average home price. I have heard people say that presidents in general are somewhat responsible for the pricing of homes, and others just say it ebs and flows with the market. Check out the 'ouput.png' file for yourself and have a look. If you want my opinion, the data is somewhat non-related. I think as the market raises, home prices raise. There is nothing else to it.

# Development Environment

I used Python, Pandas, Pyplot, and Seaborn the latter three were imported library to help with displaying the data.

# Future Work

* As of November 14 2024, there is no future work to be done with this data. Other than more projects analyzing data!
